        <p class="one">月が綺麗ですね (tsuki ga kirei desu ne) literarily means “The moon is beautiful, isn’t it?” in Japanese. Surprisingly, however, it could also contain the hidden meaning — “I love you”. It is widely believed that this meaning was coined by Sōseki Natsume (夏目漱石), a renowned Japanese novelist in the 19-20th century who was portrayed on the former 1000 yen banknote. Its alleged origin traces back to when he worked as an English teacher: when he saw his student translating “I love you” as it is into Japanese, he supposedly said, “Japanese people never say things like that shamelessly. You’d better translate it as 月が綺麗ですね (‘The moon is beautiful, isn’t it?’) or something”. Note that, however, you should take this story with a grain of salt, as there is no record left that validates it. In fact, this Japanese website (which I’ll also cite in the next section as a reference) scrupulously searched for its authoritative source, to no avail, and found out that the details of this story were a little different in some old publications from the 1970s, which said it was “月がとっても青いなあ” (“The moon is very blue”), not 月が綺麗ですね (“the moon is beautiful, isn’t it”).</p>
        <p class="two">Another thing you should keep in mind is that the ulterior meaning of this phrase is recognised only among those who love Japanese slang or trivia. Therefore, even if you act as a romanticist and confess your love to a Japanese person using this phrase, he/she may not fathom your intention, unfortunately.</p>
        <p class="three">If you google (either in Japanese or English) how to respond to “The moon is beautiful, isn’t it” in Japanese, you’ll find a plethora of websites spreading the wrong information that the “correct” or “appropriate” answer to say “I love you, too” is “死んでもいいわ (shindemo ii wa)”, which literally means “I can die (happy)” (or “I can die (for you)”, depending on how you interpret the context.)
            <br>
            First and foremost, it is NOT Sōseki Natsume who came up with the phrase “shindmo ii wa”; it is Futabatei Shimei (二葉亭四迷), another famous Japanese novelist/translator who lived in the same period as Sōseki (and thus it ended up being mixed with Sōseki’s story). Secondly, “shindemo ii wa” is NOT the translation of the English phrase “I love you, too”; it is of the Russian term “Ваша”, which means “yours” in English.</p>
